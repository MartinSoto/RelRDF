For the tests, you need the DAWG testcase data from
  http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/tests/r2.html

Extract the files so the data-r2 directory can be found by
the scripts (create a symbolic link inside relrdf/dawg, for
example).

At the moment, the testcases only work somewhat correctly
with a completely empty Postgres database as backend. To
run the testcases, specify a base, a sink and a matching
model. This might look look this:

  ./dawg-eval.sh :postgres host=localhost db=vmodell user=vmodell password=vmodell :singleversion versionId=999 :singleversion versionId=999
