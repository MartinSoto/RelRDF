This directory contains the test rig and the test data for the DAWG
test cases (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/DataAccess/tests/r2.html).

The test cases only work with a completely empty Postgres database as
backend, so, it is recommended that you create one for the purpose.

To run the test cases, use a command line similar to the following one:

  ./dawg-eval.sh :postgres host=localhost db=dawg password=xxx :plain baseGraph=http://example.com/

(the base graph name is irrelevant, any valid URI will do.)

Test results are written to log.html. They are (hopefully) self
explanatory.
